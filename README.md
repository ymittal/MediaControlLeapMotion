#Leap Motion: Media Player Controller

This project was made during a Leap Motion hackathon sponsored by ACM (Bucknell University Chapter) and KEEN (Kern Entrepreneurship Education Network) at Bucknell University on October 31, 2015.

Any Media Player which supports Mac key controls can be controlled through hand gestures. Gestures include *CircleGesture* to increase or decrease volume and *SwipeGesture* to navigate within a playlist. We also implemented *grab_strength* property to resume or stop a song.

Cheers!
